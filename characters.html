          <h1>Characters Background</h1>
          <p>According to director Hideaki Anno, Evangelion was an attempt to make
            all perspectives into one, creating characters that represent different
            things to different viewers to make it impossible for everyone to arrive
            at a single theory. To some viewers, the characters are psychological
            representations, while to others, they are philosophical, religious,
            historical, and even themselves. Anno was influenced by Ryu Murakami's
            political economy novel The Fascism of Love and Fantasy, and the names
            "Toji Suzuhara", "Kensuke Aida", and the surname "Horaki" and "Aida"
            come from this book. Many of the surnames of the characters in Evangelion
            are named after Japanese warships in World War II.</p>
          <div class="image-box">
            <img src="./img/eva_cast.png" alt="Characters">
          </div>
          <p>Most of Evangelion's characters' ages were plotted before broadcasting
            the TV series, but their birthdays were not settled. After the TV series finished,
            GAINAX released birthdays which were similar to those of each character's
            voice actors, except Rei Ayanami, Toji Suzuhara, Kensuke Aida and Kaworu
            Nagisa. This time, the characters' birth years were still unrevealed.
            Adult characters' birth years were simply calculated from their age, but
            there was an additional aspect in determining the children's ones. According
            to the Japanese educational system, in 2015 second graders of junior high
            school (eighth graders) are basically made up of children who were born from
            April 2, 2001 to April 1, 2002. Children's birth years were set in proportion
            to this rule. However these birth years did not change the children's ages of 14
            in year 2015. This is the reason why Asuka Langley Soryu and Toji Suzuhara were
            born in December 2001 and Hikari Horaki was born in February 2002, despite
            all children except Kaworu are 14 in 2015.</p>

              <h1>Shinji Ikari</h1>
              <p>Shinji Ikari is the main protagonist of Neon Genesis Evangelion and
                the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit-01. Much of the story of Evangelion
                centers around Shinji's personal struggles, both with piloting Eva and with
                his relationships with others. He is the son of "deceased" Gehirn
                bioengineer Yui Ikari and Nerv Commander (formerly Chief of Gehirn)
                Gendo Ikari. After his mother's apparent death, he was abandoned by
                his father and lived for 11 years with his "sensei," until he was
                summoned to Tokyo-3 to pilot Eva-01 against the impending Angel threat.
                He initially lives with Misato Katsuragi; although they are later joined by Asuka Langley Soryu.</p>

              <p>Rei Ayanami is the First Children and exclusive Pilot of Eva-00.
                Officially, Rei Ayanami is fourteen years old, but it is stated that
                all records of her background have been erased. Unusually for a child
                her age, Rei lives alone in an decrepit apartment. Rei attends Tokyo-3
                Junior high school and is a member of Class 2-A.</p>

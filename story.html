            <p>The story of Neon Genesis Evangelion primarily begins in 2000 with
            the "Second Impact", a global cataclysm which almost completely
            destroyed Antarctica and led to the deaths of half the human population
            of Earth. The Impact is believed by the public at large and even most
            of NERV to have been the impact of a meteorite landing in Antarctica,
            causing devastating tsunamis and a change in the Earth's axial tilt
            (leading to global climate change) and subsequent geopolitical unrest,
            nuclear war (such as the nuking of Tokyo), and general economic distress.
            Later, Second Impact is revealed to be the result of contact with and experimentation
            on the first of what are collectively dubbed the Angels: Adam. The experiments were sponsored
            by the mysterious organization SEELE, and carried out by the research organization Gehirn.</p>

          <p>In the year 2010, Gehirn had accomplished a number of its scientific

          organization NERV which is headquartered in Tokyo-3, a militarized
          civilian city located on one of the last dry sections of Japan;
          NERV's central mission is to locate the remaining Angels predicted
          by SEELE, and to destroy them. However, NERV has its own secret
          agenda, as directed by its Machiavellian commander Gendo Ikari:
          the Human Instrumentality Project, which, according to Gendo in
          episode 25, is the task of uniting all human minds into one global
          spiritual entity. Associated with NERV is the Marduk Institute,
          which has the task of selecting the pilots for the Evas, the most
          capable being children conceived after the Second Impact (14 year-olds).
          The institute consists of Commander Ikari, and NERV's chief scientist
          Ritsuko Akagi; supporting the two are 108 companies which are all revealed
          to be ghost companies.</p>

                referred to as the Second Impact, which wiped out half of the human race.
                To defend humanity against future Angel attacks, the United Nations
                established the NERV organization in Tokyo-3 to develop giant
                bio-mechanical mecha known as Evangelions. Now, the Angels have
                finally returned, and the untested Evangelions can only be piloted
                by specially selected 14 year olds. Shinji Ikari, estranged son of the
                director of NERV, Commander Gendo Ikari, arrives in Tokyo-3 and is
                dragooned into piloting Evangelion Unit-01 to fight the Angel, Sachiel,

                supersede. Unlike the Evangelion units, which rely on external
                or limited battery power, the Jet Alone has an on-board nuclear
                reactor and can thus function indefinitely without external power.
                However, during the first public test of Jet Alone, it goes out

                Escorting Asuka to Japan is Misato's old flame, Ryōji Kaji. In the
                middle of some awkward introductions and reunions, a massive aquatic
                Angel, Gaghiel, begins attacking the fleet, and Asuka determines that

                for both due to their unfriendly meeting, she takes Shinji with her.
                The Angel drags Unit-02 underwater, and Misato devises a plan to kill

                drastic step of dropping an N² bomb on the Angel, temporarily disabling
                it and giving NERV six days to find a way to defeat it. They determine
                that both parts of the Angel must be defeated perfectly simultaneously,

                their actions to pull off a coordinated dual attack set to a timed

                Tokyo-3, apparently a black and white sphere. All three Evangelions
                move in to attack, but Shinji's attack is useless, and he in Unit-01
                is absorbed into a growing shadow that has engulfed the city. Ritsuko
                determines that Leliel exists on a higher dimension of existence, which
                can only be explained by mathematical concepts. The shadow on the ground,
                described as being 600 meters wide but only three nanometers thick, is the
                actual body of the Angel, and the sphere in the sky is its true shadow.
                Fearing that Unit-01 has been completely lost, NERV prepares to drop all
                of its remaining N² bombs into the Angel, hoping that this will destroy
                Leliel even though it could easily kill Shinji as well. While trapped in

                power completely drains and life support runs out in Unit-01, Shinji falls
                unconscious, and a pair of glowing arms reach out to embrace him. Outside
                Leliel, Misato and Ritsuko witness Unit-01 violently tear its way out of
                Leliel's shadow, thereby killing it.</p>

              <p>Disaster strikes unexpectedly when NERV-02, NERV's second branch
                base in Nevada, mysteriously disappears in a flash, resulting in
                the loss of everything in a radius of eighty-nine kilometers and
                thousands of people. The incident coincided with an experiment to
                install an S² Engine, capable of giving an Evangelion an unlimited
                power supply, into Evangelion Unit-04, one of the two new Evangelions

                Unit-03. During Toji's first synch test, Unit-03 goes berserk and mutates
                into an Angel, Bardiel. Possessing both the power of an Angel and the
                form of an Evangelion, Unit-03 destroys the test facility and advances
                toward Tokyo-3. All three Evangelions are sortied against Bardiel, but
                the Angel rapidly defeats both Unit-02 and Unit-00. Although Shinji does
                not know that Toji is trapped inside Bardiel, he refuses to use Unit-01
                to attack it, wanting to try to save the pilot. As Bardiel attacks Unit-01,
                Gendo orders that Shinji be cut off from control of Unit-01 and that Unit-01's
                dummy plug autopilot system be activated. Under the control of the dummy plug,
                Unit-01 savagely attacks Bardiel, literally tearing the possessed Evangelion
                to shreds and crushing its entry plug. After the battle, the already

          <h1>What is Evangelion</h1>
          <p>Neon Genesis Evangelion, commonly referred to as Evangelion, is a
             Japanese anime series, created by Gainax, that began in October 1995.
             The anime was written and directed by Hideaki Anno (pictured),
             and co-produced by TV Tokyo and Nihon Ad Systems (NAS). It gained
             international renown and won several animation awards, and was the
             start of the Neon Genesis Evangelion series.</p>
          <p>The Evangelion series revolves around the organization NERV, using
              large mechas called Evangelions to combat monstrous beings called Angels.
              They are piloted by several of the main characters, including Shinji Ikari,
              Asuka Sohryu, and Rei Ayanami. While the initial episodes focus largely on
              religious symbols and specific references to the Bible, the later episodes
              tend to go deeper into the psyches of the characters, where it is learned
              that many of them have deep-seated emotional and mental issues. Through the
              exploration of these issues, the show begins to question reality and the
              existences therein. Much of the series's content was based on Hideaki Anno's
              own clinical depression.</p>

          <h1>The Story of Evangelion</h1>
          <p>In the year 2015, the world stands on the brink of destruction.
            Humanity's last hope lies in the hands of Nerv, a special agency under
            the United Nations, and their Evangelions, giant machines capable of
            defeating the Angels who herald Earth's ruin. Gendou Ikari, head of
            the organization, seeks compatible pilots who can synchronize with
            the Evangelions and realize their true potential. Aiding in this
            defensive endeavor are talented personnel Misato Katsuragi, Head of
            Tactical Operations, and Ritsuko Akagi, Chief Scientist.</p>
          <p>Face to face with his father for the first time in years, 14-year-old
            Shinji Ikari's average life is irreversibly changed when he is whisked
            away into the depths of Nerv, and into a harrowing new destinyâ€”he must
            become the pilot of Evangelion Unit-01 with the fate of mankind on his shoulders.</p>
